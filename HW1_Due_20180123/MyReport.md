# Excel HW - KickStart My Chart

## Unit 1 | Assignment - KickStart My Chart

### What are __three__ conclusions we can make about Kickstarter campaigns given the provided data?

* Based on the sample data provided, we can say that the most popular projects by volume on Kickstarter are theater related - specifically plays.

* The category with the highest success rate is music, with 540 of the 700 projects or **_over 77%_** meeting or exceeding their funding objectives. _All 260_ of the projects in the rock subcategory were successful.

* December is the only month where projects launched in that month have a higher chance of failing than succeeding.

### What are some of the limitations of this dataset?

* The population of just 4114 projects is a relatively small sample size, and as such the findings in this set of data may be skewed compared to the overall population.

### What are some other possible tables/graphs we could create?

* Impact of Staff Pick against status
* Impact of Spotlight against status
* Average Donation of successful projects
* Length of campaigns
* Country against status
